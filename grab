0) Prerequisites

Unity 2022.3 LTS or 2023.3 LTS

A project created with the 3D or 3D URP template

Target device: Quest 2 or Quest 3, or run in Play Mode with the XR Device Simulator

1) Install required packages

Open Window > Package Manager.

In the Packages dropdown, choose Unity Registry.

Install these packages:

XR Interaction Toolkit

XR Plugin Management

OpenXR Plugin

Input System

When prompted by XR Interaction Toolkit to enable the new Input System, click Yes and let Unity restart.

2) Enable OpenXR and the correct controller profiles

Open Edit > Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management.

In the PC, Mac & Linux Standalone tab and the Android tab:

Check OpenXR.

Still in Project Settings, go to XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR.

In Features, enable the controller profile you will use. For Quest, enable Oculus Touch Controller Profile or Meta Quest Touch Controller Profile.

Also enable Hand Tracking features only if you plan to use hands.

If you see validation issues, click Fix All.

3) Ensure Input System is active

Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings.

Active Input Handling should be set to Input System Package (New) or Both.

4) Add an XR rig to your scene

Option A - Starter Assets

Go to Window > Package Manager > XR Interaction Toolkit.

Expand Samples and import Starter Assets and XR Device Simulator.

In your Scene, add:

GameObject > XR > XR Origin (XR Rig).

If you do not see this menu, right-click Hierarchy > XR > XR Origin.

Add the XR Interaction Manager:

GameObject > XR > XR Interaction Manager.

Optional for keyboard and mouse testing:

Add GameObject > XR > XR Device Simulator. This lets you test grab with mouse and keyboard in Play Mode.

Option B - Action-based controller prefabs

If the sample includes Action Based Controller prefabs, you can use them. Otherwise, XR Origin already includes Left and Right controller GameObjects with interactor components.

5) Verify interactors on the controllers

Expand XR Origin in the Hierarchy.

You should see LeftHand Controller and RightHand Controller or similar.

Each should have:

XR Ray Interactor and/or XR Direct Interactor

XR Controller (Action-based)

Line Renderer on hands that use rays

For direct grabbing with your hands, ensure at least one of the controllers has an XR Direct Interactor. This is the interactor that physically touches and grabs objects.

6) Create your grabbable object

GameObject > 3D Object > Cube or Sphere. Rename to GrabbableBall or GrabbableBook.

With the object selected, add components:

Rigidbody

Use Gravity = On

Is Kinematic = Off

Collision Detection = Continuous is safer for fast throws

Collider

Box Collider, Sphere Collider, or Mesh Collider. Keep it non-trigger for normal physics.

XR Grab Interactable

In XR Grab Interactable:

Movement Type = Velocity Tracking for natural physics feel

Track Position = On

Track Rotation = On

Throw on Detach = On

Select Mode = Single

Press Play. Move a controller near the object. Squeeze the Grab action on your controller to pick it up. Release to drop or throw.

7) Align how it sits in your hand (Attach Transform)

Create an empty child under the grabbable object. Name it AttachPoint.

Position and rotate AttachPoint so the object would look correct in the hand when grabbed.

In XR Grab Interactable, set Attach Transform to the AttachPoint you created.

Test again until the grip looks natural.

8) Fine-tune grab behavior

Movement Type:

Kinematic: snaps and follows exactly, less physical

Velocity Tracking: follows with physics, best for throwing

Instantaneous: follows exactly every frame, can feel sticky

Smooth Position and Smooth Rotation: increase for less jitter when following the hand.

Retain Transform Parent: Off for most cases.

Interaction Layer Mask: keep Default unless you need custom layers.

9) Physics settings for better throws

Edit > Project Settings > Physics.

Increase Default Solver Iterations to 12 and Default Solver Velocity Iterations to 12 for more stable interactions.

Ensure your grabbable Rigidbody mass is realistic. Example: 0.2 kg to 1 kg for handheld items.

Avoid extremely small or extremely large scales.

10) Optional: add a socket to snap the object into place

Create an empty GameObject where you want the item to dock. Name it ItemSocket.

Add XR Socket Interactor to that object.

On the socket:

Interaction Layer Mask should match your grabbable’s layer if you use layers.

Add a simple visual like a small cylinder or outline to see where it is.

On the grabbable object:

In XR Grab Interactable, set a Collider that fits well.

Play Mode test:

Grab the object, move it into the socket area. Release. It should latch into place.

If it does not snap, ensure the socket’s Filter or Allowed Interactables are not blocking your object. You can use the socket’s “Interactable Filters” to restrict which items fit.

11) Test without a headset using XR Device Simulator

Ensure XR Device Simulator is in the scene.

Press Play.

Controls typical defaults:

Press and hold right mouse button to look around.

Shift to move the head rig.

Use keyboard shortcuts shown in the Simulator overlay to switch to left or right hand, move the hands, and simulate the grab action.

Move the simulated hand onto the object and press the grab key to test.
